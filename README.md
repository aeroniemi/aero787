# aero787

## What is it?

A set of new displays for the payware VMAX 787 built using SASL, as part of my learning of the platform. Currently includes:
*   Left PFD (all complete except the nav part at the bottom)
*   Left MFD (engine data 95%, fuel data done)
*   Left Multifunctional radio (all useful pages done with keyboard entry)

## Things to note
*   At present the overhead panel and autopilot panels don't work, need 3d modelling to fix
*   No navigational displays are fully functional
*   No right-side displays
*   No physical FMS available yet

## Installation
Download the repository, and extract to the folder of the aircraft
